Terraform Resource Blocks
Terraform uses resource blocks to manage infrastructure, such as virtual networks, compute instances, or higher-level components such as DNS records.
Resource blocks represent one or more infrastructure objects in your Terraform configuration.
Most Terraform providers have a number of different resources that map to the appropriate APIs to manage that particular infrastructure type.

When working with a specific provider, like AWS, Azure, or GCP, the resources are defined in the provider documentation. 
Each resource is fully documented in regards to the valid and required arguments required for each individual resource
